## 🧑‍💻About me

Hi there! I'm Stanislav.
I'm primarily an **Android developer** who enjoys building apps with clean architecture and modern tools.  
I work mostly with **Kotlin**, **Jetpack**, and the **Android SDK**.  
I use **Arch Linux** as my main development environment.  
I'm also interested in **DevOps**, automation, microcontrollers, and exploring concepts from **Computer Science**, such as algorithms, data structures, and system design.
